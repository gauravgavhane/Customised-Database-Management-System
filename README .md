# Customized Database Management System (CDBMS)

Customized Database Management System (CDBMS) replicates core SQL functionalities using Java. Features include creating tables, inserting, fetching, deleting records, and applying aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, COUNT). Built with Java's Collection Framework, it provides a menu-driven interface to understand DBMS concepts programmatically.

## Features

- **Table Creation**: Define and create custom tables.
- **Record Insertion**: Insert new records into tables.
- **Data Fetching**: Retrieve records with various query options.
- **Record Deletion**: Remove specific records from tables.
- **Aggregate Functions**:
  - **SUM**: Calculate the sum of a specified column.
  - **AVG**: Compute the average of a specified column.
  - **MIN**: Find the minimum value in a specified column.
  - **MAX**: Identify the maximum value in a specified column.
  - **COUNT**: Count the total number of records.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **Java Collection Framework**: Utilized for data handling and manipulation.
- **Menu-driven Interface**: Provides an interactive way to use the CDBMS.

## Usage

1. **Launch the Program**: Run the Java application.
2. **Menu Interaction**: Use the menu to navigate through various functionalities like creating tables, inserting records, etc.
3. **Apply Functions**: Use aggregate functions to analyze your data.

## Purpose

The CDBMS project is designed to offer a programmatic understanding of database management concepts, making it a valuable learning tool for students and developers interested in databases.

## How to Run
